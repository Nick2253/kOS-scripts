This file is the reference for all the runmodes used in my scripts:

0 - Initialization.  In this runmode, the script should do some basic checks of the ship and its surroundings, and determine which runmode the script should go to next.
5 - Plot intercept.
10 - Takeoff in atmosphere.
15 - Takeoff in vacuum.
20 - Circularization.
30 - Transfer to a different orbit.  This would usually be followed by a circularization step.
50 - Land in atmosphere.
55 - Land in vacuum.
